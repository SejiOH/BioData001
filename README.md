<h2>Biology data set analysis</h2>

This is the <u>first</u> experience of data analysis in bioinfomatics.
So, naturally, I need to look up the internet to find out how to handle the dna sequence.

And originally this project was given as an interview assignment, so I had done in a day.

<b>Code challenge:</b>
Generate a model in any DL/ML frameworks and use this data to learn to classify
a 60 element DNA sequence into the categories of IE, EI or neither.

<b>Reference:</b>
Data set: Dua, D. and Karra Taniskidou, E. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml].
Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.
Here is the website that I have gained the information how to analyze DNA data:
