Biology data set analysis

This is one of the most difficult challenge that I have faced so far because I do have no experience of data analysis in bioinfomatics.
And originally this project was done in a day 
So, naturally, I need to look up the internet to find out how to handle the dna sequence.

Here is the website that I have gained the information how to analyze DNA data.
